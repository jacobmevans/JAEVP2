Project 2 for Data Structures and Introduction to Algorithmic Analysis.

This project was to write a class that implements a Trie data structure. A trie efficently stores words, which can be used in many different implementations, such as a spell checker or word game. Tries are generally of degree 26, representing the 26 letters of the english alaphabet, but can be expanded depending on the circumstance. 

For this implementation of a Trie, and to help simplify testing, all words were restricted to strings of lower-case characters, which excluded spaces and any form of punctuation. Words are also restricted to be of at most 20 characters long, to help in the simplicity of testing.
